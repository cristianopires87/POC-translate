# Mulesoft-Microsoft Translator
Working with cross-functional teams in an organization can be challenging especially when team members are located in different parts of the globe or speak different languages.  A common team collaboration tool used in cross-functional teams is Slack. A common problem on the platform is when two co-workers speak different languages, how do you communicate effectively?  As the world becomes more connected, thereâ€™s becoming an increased demand for real-time translation in cross-functional organizations. Luckily, Slack has a potential solution to this problem: Slack Apps and Slash Commands.  We can use the Microsoft Translator Text API and Slack to convert messages from English to Spanish, however, each API requires a different JSON payload output and input.  To solve this integration issue between these systems, we will use the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio to handle and host the integration.
